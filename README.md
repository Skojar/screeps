This is the repository for my [screeps](https://screeps.com/) code.
As is appropriate, everything is a work in progress.

## Design Principles

### Maximize automation
> If I wanted to play an RTS where I fiddle with manual instructions for everything, and agonize over the ideal placement of whatever, there are plenty of those out there.  Screeps is, to my mind, a game where the challenge is writing code that approximates the results with minimum input from the player.
> So, my goal is to remove interference from me whenever possible.  This means, first and foremost, whenever I do have to step in and manually direct anything, that should get documented as an issue and a solution should be added to the code.
> This of course puts me at a disadvantage to other players, but, again, there are lots of opportunities to PvP.  Screeps is for playing with <code>code</code>.

### Demonstrate a Preference for Stigmergic Solutions
> Instead of implementing a central controller object that makes decisions and coordinates all the other in-game objects, my goal is to decentralize.  This is largely an aesthetic choice; I'm not sure it has a positive impact on preformance, and it's more likely to have a negative one, but I like the idea.

### Accept a Variety of Solutions and Evolving Code
> Since part of the reason to play is the learn to code better, I'm not adverse to having multiple approaches implemented along side each other, even if refactoring everything to match might have advantages.
> That said, refactoring is an excellent chance to get some practice, so the code *should be* in a constant state of evolution as new techniques are learned.
