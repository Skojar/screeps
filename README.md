screeps code ideas

1. replace frequent function calls that just gather data to a gatherData(spawn) function, and put the data in memory.
2. move all the architect stuff to the spawn module.
3. fix center and radius, and use it to design walls?
4. or use some fluid mechanism (like the scout road building), or a combination of both.
